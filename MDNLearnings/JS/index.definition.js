/**
 * How Javascript works in background
 * When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code 
 * (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). 
 * This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product 
 * (the web page).
 * 
 * The JavaScript is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine, 
 * after the HTML and CSS have been assembled and put together into a web page.
 * This ensures that the structure and style of the page are already in place 
 * by the time the JavaScript starts to run.
